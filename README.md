# 🎯 Miktos Skills - Extracted & Organized

**Valuable skills extracted from the original skills-library for integration with unified miktos-core architecture.**

## 📋 **Purpose**

This repository contains **carefully extracted and organized skills** from the original distributed skills-library, specifically prepared for integration with the **unified miktos-core architecture**.

### ✅ **What's Included**
- **modeling_tools.py** - Complete 3D modeling skill implementations
- **shading_tools.py** - Material and shader creation tools  
- **Standardized response format** - Compatible with current FlexibleSmartProcessor
- **Type hints and documentation** - Professional-grade skill definitions
- **Error handling** - Robust validation and error reporting

### 🎯 **Integration Ready**
These skills are designed to work seamlessly with your current:
- `smart_processor_flexible.py` pattern matching system
- Unified miktos-core backend architecture
- Standardized skill execution framework

## 🚀 **Skills Overview**

### **Modeling Tools** (`modeling_tools.py`)
```python
# Professional 3D modeling operations
create_primitive(primitive_type='sphere', size=3.0, location=(0,0,0))
extrude_faces(object_name='Cube', face_indices=[0,1,2], extrude_distance=0.5)
subdivide_surface(object_name='Cube', subdivision_level=2, smooth=True)
apply_mirror_modifier(object_name='Character', axis='X', use_clipping=True)
create_array_modifier(object_name='Pillar', count=5, offset_distance=3.0)
```

### **Shading Tools** (`shading_tools.py`)
```python
# PBR material creation and management
create_pbr_material('Steel', base_color=(0.7,0.7,0.8), metallic=0.9, roughness=0.3)
apply_material_to_object(object_name='Cube', material_name='Steel')
create_procedural_texture('RustNoise', texture_type='noise', scale=5.0)
```

## 🔧 **Integration with Current System**

### **Compatible with FlexibleSmartProcessor**
Your current `smart_processor_flexible.py` can easily integrate these skills:

```python
# Add to your pattern matcher
{
    "command": "apply subdivision",
    "action": "subdivide_surface", 
    "parameters": {"subdivision_level": 2, "smooth": True},
    "keywords": ["subdivision", "subdivide", "smooth"],
    "confidence": 0.95,
    "category": "modeling"
}
```

### **Standardized Response Format**
All skills return consistent responses that work with your current system:
```python
{
    "status": "success",
    "message": "Operation completed successfully", 
    "data": {...},
    "execution_time": 0.045
}
```

## 📦 **Next Steps for Integration**

1. **Copy skills** into your `miktos-core/skills/` directory
2. **Update pattern matcher** to include new skill actions
3. **Test integration** with your current backend
4. **Extend as needed** for your specific workflows

## 🎯 **Value Proposition**

- ✅ **Professional-grade implementations** with proper error handling
- ✅ **Type-safe with full documentation** for maintainability  
- ✅ **Compatible with your current architecture** - no major changes needed
- ✅ **Extensible foundation** for adding more skills
- ✅ **Production-ready** with comprehensive validation
